# 🎓 Admission Prediction Project (Jupyter Notebook)

This project explores and predicts student admissions using various machine learning models. It is built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python and popular data science libraries.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The notebook uses a dataset named `admission_data.csv`, which includes student academic features such as:

- Test scores  
- CGPA  
- Other factors relevant to admission prediction

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Jupyter Notebook  
- Python 3.x  
- `pandas`, `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`, including:

  - Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Lasso Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Preprocessing and evaluation metrics
